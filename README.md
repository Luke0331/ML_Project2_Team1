# **Climate Prediction Project 2**
## *From black box to explanable AI: the trade-off between accuracy, complexity, and explainability*

This repository contains **group 1's** project where we have expanded upon the analysis carried out by **Sane et al. (2023) "Parameterizing vertical mixing coefficients in the ocean surface boundary layer using neural networks." Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems 15.10: [e2023MS003890](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023MS003890)** by introducing new machine learning methods to predict shape function  g(Ïƒ) based on input physical parameters N(1). Machine learning methods range in complexity, explainability, and performance.  

Group Members: Kechao Lu (KL), Zhi Wang(ZW), Alexandra Crookshanks(AC)  

Contribution Statement: KL, ZW and AC co-designed the project topic. ZW, KL and AC were responsible for neural network section, Gaussian process section, and symbolic regression section, respectively. Conclusions were drawn based on the results from the three parts altogether.  

Final code implimentations and explanations are contained within ML_Project2_Team1.ipynb
