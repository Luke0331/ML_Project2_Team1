# **Climate Prediction Project 2**
## *From black box to explanable AI: the trade-off between accuracy of complexity*

This repository contains **group 1's** project where we have expanded upon the analysis carried out by **Sane et al. (2023) "Parameterizing vertical mixing coefficients in the ocean surface boundary layer using neural networks." Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems 15.10: [e2023MS003890](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023MS003890)** by introducing new machine learning methods to predict shape function  g(Ïƒ) based on input physical parameters N(1). Machine learning methods range in complexity, explainability, and performance.
